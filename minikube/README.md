The [Minikube Headlamp Plugin](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins/minikube) extends Headlamp so that it has support for the Minikube Kubernetes distribution.

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) is a lightweight tool that simplifies the process of setting up a Kubernetes environment on your local PC. It provides a localStorage, single-node Kubernetes cluster that you can use for learning, development, and testing purposes.
